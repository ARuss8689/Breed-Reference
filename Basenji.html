			This quiet and graceful dog evolved in a warm climate. Tan color provides camouflage, and white patches on the hair and short coat on the ears and body all help with heat tolerance. These factors, as well as the Basenji's silence while tracking game, make it an efficient hunter. Most breeds of dog have two breeding cycles each year but, like the wolf, the Basenji has only one. Also like the wolf, it rarely barks, lending it the name 'The Barkless Dog'. Instead, it howls in a curious voice not unlike the sound of an alpine yodeler. It is docile with humans.
