			All dogs offer companionship- they seem to understand our emotions. Most look upon the people they live with as members of their own pack- even the fiercest guard dog usually acts like a teddy bear with the people he or she knows. Almost all cultures in the world keep pets, usually dogs, for no obvious purpose other than companionship. Some breeds were developed simply to offer warmth, company, and entertainment. These were generally small dogs, originally created for the amusement of wealthy women.

			As their name would suggest, most companion breeds are friendly, affectionate, and loyal. They are usually gentle and amiable around children and other dogs. Some breeds have a tendency to be protective around their family, which may lead to an aggressive nature, however, this rarely manifests itself as physical violence.
