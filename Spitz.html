			No group of dogs has had a more influential relationship with humans than the spitz-type breeds that evolved throughout the Arctic regions of the world, in what are now the Scandinavian countries, and in Russia, Alaska, and Canada. The liaison between spitz-type dogs and many people living in these harsh regions is highly interdependent- it is likely that the groups of people along the Arctic seas, across the tundra, and on Arctic islands would not have survived without the help of these versatile canines.

			Spitz-types are well suited to living in harsh northern climates. Many spitz-type breeds retain wolf-like characteristics like independence, suspiciousness, and aggression towards unfamiliar humans or other dogs, and they require much training and socialization when they are puppies before they become manageable in a city or apartment.
