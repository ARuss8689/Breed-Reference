		<div class="breeds">
			Bred for speed, with an aerodynamic build for flying like arrows after their prey, sight hounds are almost invariably tall, long, lean, lithe, running hounds. They are products of selective breeding thousands of years ago that was as sophisticated as any selective breeding done today. Some of them are obviously close relatives of the primitive dogs, and the distinction between the two groups is arbitrary. All sighthounds emanated from Southwestern Asia.

			Sight hounds tend to be relatively more high strung than other breeds, but this is also part of not getting enough exercise. Ideally these dogs need to run for at least an hour or more per day in a large enough space that allows them to really get up to speed and keep going. They also tend to much more excitable and also very affectionate, highly interested in their families but often very aloof and stand-offish with strangers.

			<br>
			The sight hounds also may be somewhat challenging to train as they are very attuned to owner's tone of voice and body language. Some sight hounds may be challenging to housetrain and will need to be kept on a leash to prevent them from running off after anything they see as prey. These dogs can also be very submissive around other dogs and may have difficulty in adjusting to homes with highly dominant breeds.
