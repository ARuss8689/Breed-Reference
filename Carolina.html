			The Carolina Dog was discovered and named by Dr. I. Lehr Brisbin, a biology professor at the University of Georgia, in South Carolina, in a remote area from which the public has been excluded. Wild dogs had lived in the area for centuries have had little opportunity to breed with domestic dogs. Brisbin noted that these dogs were almost identical in looks to the Dingo. Other scientists observed that the Carolina's bone structure was very similar to the remains of neolithic dog bones from Native American burial sites thousands of years old. It tends to be extremely shy and needs careful handling.
