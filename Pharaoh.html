			Skeleton remains indicate that hunting dogs similar to the Pharaoh Hound have existed in the Middle East for at least 5,000 years. After the Roman invastion of Egypt 2,000 years ago, similar dogs spread throughout the rest of the Mediterranean, possibly traded by Phoenicians and Carthaginians. They survived particularly well are distinct breeds in relatively isolated places such as the Maltese and Balearic Islands and Sicily, but also in France and mainland Italy. Perhaps due to its rich red color and its rediscovery by dog breeders in the 1960s, the Pharaoh Hound has become the most popular of these descendants of the Egyptian Hound. Unlike the Greyhound, which hunts by sight alone, the Pharaoh Hound hunts by sight, sound, and smell. Affectionate with its owner, it is sometimes sensitive with strangers.
