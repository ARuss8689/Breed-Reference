			The label 'primitive' is an arbitrary one applied to a small group of dogs that are descended from the Indian Plains Wolf. Some members of this group are genuinely primitive, in that they are at an early, or arrested, stage of domestication. Others, although they are descended from the same root stock, have been dramatically affected by human intervention and breeding.

			With the exception of the Dingo and New Guinea Singing Dog, primitive breeds are reasonably easy to train in obedience. They are always alert, but can be rather aloof. Some remain at an early stage of human intervention, and lack selected traits such as enhanced sight and scenting ability, power, or friendly natures.
