		<div class="breeds">
			The Dingo is a breed that has never been fully domesticated. This is partly due to its remote isolation, but also to lack of human intervention. It does not have the same degree of thooth crowding and shortening of the jaw that distinguish other breeds in this group from their ancestor, the Indian Plains Wolf. Also like the wolf, the female Dingo has only one breeding cycle each year. Originally kept by some Australian Aboriginal groups as pets, the breed also served as a sentry, camp cleaner, and an emergency source of food. Today, the Dingo is rarely kept as a companion animal.
