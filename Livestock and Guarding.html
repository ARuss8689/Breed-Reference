			Guarding a person's campsite or homestead is a natural way for a dog to behave. In the delta between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, in what is now Iraq, where our hunter ancestors became cultivators and farmers, this natural guarding activity was extended to protecting livestock. Shepherds discovered that if dogs were raised with sheep, goats, or cattle from puppyhood, they looked after these animals as if they were members of their own pack. Canine guardians soon became indispensable.

			Guarding and herding breeds vary in looks and temperament, but are generally large, protective, attentive, and trustworthy. Their size and protective nature can make them less than ideal for urban or even suburban living. Despite their size, they can be gentle, make good companion dogs, and are often protective towards children.
