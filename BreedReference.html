			<h3>
				A Brief History of Dogs
			</h3>
			
				All modern dog breeds are descended from the wolf. It is unlikely, however, that this initial divergence was the result of intentional selective breeding, but rather due to 'self-domestication'- i.e., natural selection. As long as 12,000 years ago, wolves were attracted to the sites of human habitation- an environment that favored small, sociable animals. As a result, the first stages of the modern dog that we have all come to know and love, were born!
				<br>
				<br>
				While these natural pressures resulted in the wolf becoming smaller and more relaxed with humans, it was only after many generations of selective breeding that the great diversity of dog breeds developed. Among many other changes, intensive selection increased barking, valuable as a warning device. Additionally, ears and tails were altered to distinguish domesticated dogs from wild ones. Initially, dogs were bred to be considerably smaller than wolves, but size was later enhanced- producing the 'giant' breeds we see today.

			<h3>
				Choosing Your Breed
			</h3>
			
				There are more than 400 recognized dog breeds and breed varieties throughout the world, and this number is constantly changing. Breeds- groups of dogs that, when bred together, produce descendants which both look and behave like their parents- come and go. Many breeds have become extinct in the last century alone, while new breeds have been created.
				<br>
				<br>
				The best way to begin to choose the right dog for you is by choosing a functionality classification. The AKC (American Kennel Club) recognizes 7 distinct classifications: <a href="http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/groups/sporting/" target="_blank">Sporting</a>, <a href="http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/groups/hound/" target="_blank">Hound</a>, <a href="http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/groups/working/" target="_blank">Working</a>, <a href="http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/groups/terrier/" target="_blank">Terriers</a>, <a href="http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/groups/toy/" target="_blank">Toys</a>, <a href="http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/groups/herding/" target="_blank">Herding</a>, and <a href="http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/groups/non-sporting/" target="_blank">Non-Sporting</a> dogs. On this site, however, we will be categorizing functionality a little differently, as you can see from the classifications at the top of the page. There can be some overlap between classifications, as not every breed fits perfectly into just one category, however, as a guideline, these divisions are quite accurate. While most dogs, at least to some extent, conform to breed standards, each dog is unique and has his or her own temperment and personality. With such variety, and such a multitude of factors, choosing the right breed for you can be very tricky. When you've found that special someone, however, it will all be worth it!
