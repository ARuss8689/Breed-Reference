			Explorers in the 1800s described the varying popularity of dogs in the lowland villages of New Guinea- in some they were treated as pets, while in others they were abused. By this century, hybridization with imported dogs had made the indigenous, lowland New Guinea Dog almost extinct. In the 1950s, however, two pure dogs were captured in the isolated Lavanni Valley in the southern highlands, and eventually sent to Taronga Park Zoo in Sydney, Australia. In the 1970s, another pair was captured in Irian Jaya's Eipomak Valley, part of Indonesia. Virtually all Singing Dogs in Europe and North America descend from these pairs. This boisterous breed has a unique sing-song howl, which is curiously plaintive.
