			Terriers evolved from hounds, which were miniaturized and dwarfed through selective breeding. Breeding also considered personality- the terrier's aggressive instinct was enhanced, so that it would work ruthlessly and efficiently, without backing down, when confronted by a fox or badger. There is no group of dogs more expert at tunneling than terriers- these feisty dogs still willingly engage in head-on combat with earth-dwelling mammals on their opponents' home territories.

			As family pets, terriers are a joy. They love the rough and tumble, have unlimited energy, are ever alert, and provide constant entertainment. Even the smallest individual, however, retains its instinct to nip. Most terrier make excellent city pets, and if excessive yapping is controlled at an early age, they make superb watchdogs and loyal defenders of their realms.
