		<div class="breeds">
			For thousands of years, sighthounds and scenthounds accompanied hunters in search of food or in pursuit of sport. Natural genetic variations of coat texture, length of bone, scenting ability, and levels of obedience had always occurred, but with the introduction of firearms to hunting, breeders took a far greater interest in these and other traits. Dog breeding subsequently took a dramatic leap forward, producing highly responsive and amenable workers. Today, these trustworthy breeds are some of the world's most popular canine companions.

			This group of dogs is generally easier to train than any other. Gundogs are almost invariably relaxed with children, less inclined than any other groups to fight among themselves, and, in most instances, willingly obey commands.
