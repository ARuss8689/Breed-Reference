			While sighthounds rely upon vision and great speed to capture or corner prey, scenthounds use their noses and profound stamina to wear down game and bring it to bay. Although dogs use all their senses when hunting, hearing is relatively unimportant to the scenthound. While the sighthound chases silently, the scenthound hunts methodically, and will bark or howl when it encounters the scent trail of its prey. Their formidable scenting is beyond human comprehension.

			Scenthounds are generally amenable, and more willing to live together than other types of dogs. Scenthounds are usually reliable with children and other dogs. As a group, they are not as demonstrative as terriers, as affectionate as companion dogs, or as trainable as gundogs. Scenthounds are most content when working, whether it be trailing scents, or following paw prints.
