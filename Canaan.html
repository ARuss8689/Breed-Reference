			The Canaan Dog was originally employed by the Bedouins as both a herder and guard dog in the Negev Desert. Today's breed, which was developed in the 1930s, has proved to be exceptionally versatile. During World War II, a number of Canaans were trained for mine detection; after the war, members of the breed were even used as guide dogs for the blind. Although rather aloof, it does make a good companion. Increasingly popular in its country of origin, the breed has now spread to the United States.
