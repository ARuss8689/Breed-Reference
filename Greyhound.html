			Capable of reaching 43 mph, the elegant Greyhound is the dog world's most important speed merchant. This surprisingly gentle breed uses speed and sight to overtake prey, be it a living animal in the field or desert, or a mechanical rabbit on a dog track. The pet Greyhound is a delightful and relaxed companion, although dogs that have retired from racing have a tendency to chase anything that moves.
