			Also known as the 'Mexican Hairless Dog', how this breed arrived in Mexico will probably remain a mystery. Images of what appear to be hairless dogs can be found in ancient Aztec ruins; it is more likely, however, that these are other indigenous mammals- it seems that the Aztecs at one time "created" naked animals by using resin to remove the hair from guinea pigs, which then served as food and bed warmers. This alert, lively, and affectionate breed is often compared to both ancient African pariah dogs and European terriers. Its physical structure is reminiscent of classic sighthounds, but its personality can be very similar to the Fox Terrier's.
